 * Create unit tests for the Line Class (see video).
 *     Create a file called LineTest.java.
 *     Create tests for the getSlope, getDistance, and parallelTo methods.
 *     Because of rounding errors, it is bad practice to test double values for exact equality.
 *     To get around this, you can pass a small value (such as .0001) to assertEquals to be used as a delta.
